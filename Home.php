		<p id="p-sidebar">Here, I will be posting some cool links to and information about the latest technologies.
		These posts will be emphasize on the latest techs emerging from <strong class="africa">Africa</strong> as a continent.
		There is a great need for the awareness of these type of technology news in order to attract a great number of investor and 
		entrepreneurs around the globe. Just as the western world needs foreign investors, so does <strong class="africa">Africa</strong> need 
		them. The wrong perception is a killer.</p></div>

        <div id="par-one">
		<p>I started college thinking I knew, career-wise, what my future ambition is; I thought wrong. 
		The more computer science classes I took, the more I changed my decisions on what area of technology I would concentrate on. 
		<span class="cis"><strong>Computer Information Systems</strong></span>, a broad major, is the major that best suits my indecisive nature towards my career.
		I had browsed, like I was shopping, through the web for different professions in the CIS industry but to no avail.
		Finally, like a flabbergasted kid who just got a surprise from his father, I realized that web development is actually what I am called to do! 
		I currently enjoy it. I am still learning; of course, it is technology..duh!</p></div>

        <p>
			<strong class="africa">Africa</strong>: The land truly flowing with milk and honey. 
			<br><strong class="africa">Africa</strong>: The land of abundance.
			<br><strong class="africa">Africa</strong>: The land with infinite natural resources. 
			<br> Now, the question is why is the picture above an instance of what many in the western part of the world would instantly picture,
			in their mind, when they hear "Africa"? 
			<Strong class="africa">Africa</strong> is so rich that there should be no one soul living in penury.
			Of course, there is corruption in its government. Of course, there are rural and poor environments. 
			<span id="afric-africa">That single story of <strong class="africa">Africa</strong> is hurting it.</span> It has its beautiful sceneries as well; beautiful people, tasty foods,
			interesting cultures and traditions, and breathe-taking architectures. <br><strong id="note">NOTE:</strong>
			<strong class="africa">Africa</strong> is a continent housing over 53 countries.
